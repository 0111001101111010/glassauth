Google Authenticator for Google Glass
===========

Get your 2-step authentication codes on Google Glass

- Grab the ZXing barcode scanner for Android from https://code.google.com/p/zxing/downloads/list Install it on your Google Glass device. This would be an ideal patch for someone to submit, since there's no technical reason for not just using the library inside of the app
- Build and deploy Google Authenticator for Google Glass.
- On the first run, you will need to scan the generated barcode for 2-step authentication prior to use. After that, you will be able to view anything you need to.
